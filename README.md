# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction

A machine learning project in **Python** to predict rainfall conditions for a specific region using historical weather data.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a software system that can **predict rainfall conditions** (such as likelihood or amount) for any given area based on historical meteorological data. The model leverages machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and help forecast weather-related events like rainfall. 1

## 🧾 Dataset

The project uses a comprehensive rainfall dataset sourced from **Kaggle**, comprising over **115 years of rainfall data from all Indian states**. This rich dataset enables the model to learn rainfall patterns across different regions and seasons. 2

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data loading and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning models  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization (optional)

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   Load historical rainfall data and inspect for missing or inconsistent values.  
2. **Preprocessing**  
   Clean data, handle missing values, and extract useful features.  
3. **Model Training**  
   Train machine learning models (e.g., regression or classification) to predict rainfall based on features like humidity, temperature, wind speed, and pressure data.  
4. **Prediction & Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model performance using standard metrics such as RMSE, MAE, or accuracy.
